# Robotics Knowledge Graph

This project explores the interconnections between key components of a robotic system using a knowledge graph approach. By representing hardware parts (like motors, sensors, and controllers) and their functional relationships in the form of triples (subject–verb–object), we visualize how different elements of a robot interact and support one another.
It uses Python and NetworkX to build and visualize the graph based on triples data.

## Features
- Builds a directed graph from (subject, relation (verb), object) triples
- ex: Subject-->[realtion or an action (verb)]-->object / AI Module ──[makes decisions for]--> Robot Arm
- Visualizes the graph using matplotlib; python Library
- Helps understand how sensors, motors, and controllers connect

## How to run
1. Open the RoboticsKnowledgeGrpah (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UDBXTwaNNO3nc4guniy9KJ8HU68omLPa?usp=sharing) notebook in Google Colab 
2. Run all cells to see the graph visualization
3. The grap is saved automatically in the notebook

## About Me
I’m currently studying engineering, and one thing I’ve discovered along the way is how much I love learning new things—especially topics I never imagined exploring before.
Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as really fascinated by robotics and how everything connects.
Even though I’m on the path to becoming a mechanical engineer, I truly believe that learning about AI and its related fields is not just useful—it’s necessary.
We’re in a time where the boundaries between disciplines are disappearing, and I want to be someone who keeps growing, learning, and building skills across different areas, not just sticking to one.
For me, combining mechanical engineering (specialized mechatronics) with AI feels like the future, and I’m excited to be part of that journey.

Feel free to reach out or contribute!
